## Build server

## Userstories

- As a user who is sitting at home learning things, I want to see a joke, so I can be entertained
- As child I who wants to be entertained, I want to see an age appropriate joke, so my childhood is not ruined

## Business logic

- We want to use this app in the browser

## Plan

## Setup

- [x] make folder
- [x] start tracking our work in git
- [] commit our work as we go
- [x] if we use package, we want to .gitignore our node_modules
- [x] initialize package.json (npm init) -> so we can install libraries
- [x] install the package we need: express
- [] configure our express
  - [] import the library and use it
  - [] set a port
  - [] make our server listen

## Building a feature

- [] define a route, the user can send requests to
- [] we take the input from the `request` that user sent us
- [] send a response to the user with a joke
